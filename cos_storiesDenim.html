        <p>
            <strong>Eternal fashion item, denim</strong>
            Denim has been around for years since it was first produced in the 1800s. Even today,<br>\
            many designers are using denim to make sustainable fashion a reality.<br>
            From recycled denim to denim that is repaired and worn again.<br>
            The longevity of denim depends on the habit of choosing a good product and taking good care of it.
        </p>

            <div>
                <p>Think of it as the most important moment in your life.
                    Were you not even wearing denim at that moment ? Denim jeans that have been worn over the years , denim jackets that have been purchased for the first time, and denim, the most popular in the fashion industry, have long been firmly established as fashion items.
                    How can we take care of and store our denim products to keep them looking like new even decades later?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>BUY BETTER: CHOOSE RESPONSIBLE DENIM</strong>
                    First of all, if you choose denim made of good fabric, you can say that you have taken the first step toward sustainable consumption.
                    The various styles of denim presented by COS are all made from 100% organic cotton,
                    and most are 65% recycled cotton denim made from scraps or leftovers from the production process.
                    The COS Atelier team goes through a total of four stages of repair to create the best fit,
                    and is doing its best to make sustainable products by removing non-recyclable rivets (watch pockets,
                    metal buttons). There is nothing more important than being able to wear it for a long time. Francesca Lilley,
                    COS's Sustainability Team Leader, said, 'The philosophy of COS is to make clothes that can be worn for a long time.
                    In order to make clothes that can be worn for a long time, we design products by taking advantage of various characteristics of fabrics.
                    A good product doesn't change even if you wear it over and over again.' like you said
                </p>

                    <strong>KEEP FOREVER: MAKE IT LAST</strong>
                    Denim Laundry, Should I? Should I not? Experts say you should never wash your denim. Yes. Denim will last longer if you don't wash it often. Due to the nature of the fabric,
                    as time goes by, it wrinkles and changes shape to suit each individual's body shape.
                    It can also be called the charm of denim. However, if the conditions that must be turned over wash denimWash with a special detergent and wash in warm water,
                    taking care not to damage the fabric too much. Fabric softeners should be avoided as much as possible. COS designer Rebecca Liesenfeld said,
                    'This is because fabric softeners can weaken the denim tissue and cause shrinkage.' speaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you follow these guidelines when caring for your denim, you can prevent it from fading and retain its original color and feel for a long time.
                    And it's not that hard to recycle or upcycle damaged clothes to mend them.
                    Of course, you can cut your jeans and try them on into shorts, or leave it to the experts. It's your choice.
                    In fact, many brands even offer tailoring services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>CLOSE THE LOOP: RECYCLE In</strong>
                    a word, denim can last for a long time if you take good care of it. Spend wisely.
                    Like a COS product, not only the pockets, but every part that goes into the
                    fabric is made from 100% sustainable materials.
                    Reduce wasted resources and give us one more chance to be reborn as a new product.
