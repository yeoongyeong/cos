                ' Athens is a city where East and West, old and new, order and chaos are mixed.' The image and feel
                of a beautiful city that people usually think of may be different,
                but it is a city with a special charm. Athens is like the scent of orange blossom before Easter, and
                it's like an outdoor cinema. Besides,
                it is a city with a beautiful waterfr ont and a magnificent Acropolis Athens is most beautiful when
                dawn illuminates the empty streets.
            </p>
            <p>
                'I was born in Piraeus, a port city in Athens that is not well known to people. Over the years, I
                have come to realize that my hometown and the experiences
                I grew up with have been instrumental in developing my identity and creativity. Contrary to the
                imagination of people who think they will love and hate their homeland.
                After staying in Athens for too long, the shortcomings are visible, but as an editor and
                photographer, I travel a lot and I feel welcome when I return to Athens.'
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>MY CITY</strong>
                'I consider myself lucky to be able to live in my favorite center of Athens. It's nice to have
                everything you need nearby.
                For example, morning coffee, going to buy necessities, or getting together with friends for a glass
                of wine in the evening.
                It is also attractive that you can enjoy the culture nearby and meet various people through short
                conversations.
                The center of Athens has a large central market, small shops and shops selling imported goods.
                And it's nice to be able to get to all the places of Athens on foot without having to use a car or
                public transport.
                Omonoia in Athens may look outdated, but if you look through the streets, there are many things to
                see,
                so be sure to visit the town of Plaka under the Acropolis.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'Athens has developed a lot in recent years and I think it's the most interesting city.' The
                cultural and artistic world is also growing,
                and the quality of work is also improving.
                My favorite restaurant called Seychelles is located around the Kerameikos square, the ancient
                cemetery in Athens.
                I really like everything on the seasonal menu, but my favorite is pasta with buffalo meat and sour
                cheese.
                Browse your favorite records at the Monastiraki flea market while enjoying delicious coffee and
                traditional Greek food Tyripita,
                have lunch at the Diporto taverna, and in the evening with friends under the Acropolis.
                A glass of wine would make a perfect day in Athens.'

                    <strong>ON ATHENS' EVOLUTION</strong>
                    'I think that the explosive growth of the tourism industry is the other side of Athens.
                    It's a pity to see hotels appearing on every street you pass and the unique neighborhoods
                    becoming uniform due to the phenomenon of gentrification. It's difficult to strike a balance between
                    identity and growth,
                    but I don't want Athens to be like any other city in the world. It's a really serious problem to see the
                    same shops
                    and restaurants wherever you go.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>MY PROCESS</strong>
                    'I have a lot of curiosity, so I always have a camera in my hand to take pictures.
                    The creative part of our daily life seems to be inseparable and I think it is a part of life.
                    I wanted to create an image that could elicit certain emotions.
                    It was amazing how images convey the artist's message in the most direct and truthful way.
                    Whether writing or taking pictures, I always really want to work.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I love collecting images online, so I have thousands of images on my hard drive.
                    I think appreciating images is a big inspiration to me, and I think this habit has a big impact
                    on my aesthetics. Inspired by the films of Edward Young, Tsai Ming-liang and Wong Kar-wai,
                    it has changed the way we see the world. Among photographers, I especially like Joel Meyrowitz,
                    Takashi Honma and Tina Barney.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'When I started taking pictures as a child, I was greatly influenced by Wong Kar-wai'
                    cinematographer Christopher Doyle, so I traveled around the city to develop my dream of photography.
                    I've always been fascinated by the lights of Athens,
                    so I did a fashion photo shoot in the evening for the Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi community.'
