            Los Angeles is not only famous for being one of Hollywood's glamorous streets, <br>
            but it's also a place where you can get a glimpse of a different way of life. <br>
            Hear the story of Los Angeles from Ryan Willms.

                    It's a city where people who like to interact with other people and those who like to stay at home can create their own lifestyle.'

                <p>
                    'In my case, I realized many things while focusing on emotional well-being,
                    and I thought it would be good to share the lessons I learned with others.
                    It made a difference in my life. It gave me a chance to look deep inside.'

                    <strong>MY CITY</strong>
                    'It's not easy to feel the charm of Los Angeles all at once.
                    There are so many different cultures and things to do.
                    Small towns come together to form a large city. When you get used to the unique lifestyle here,
                    you'll appreciate the city's charm.'

                <p>
                    'If you go north of LA along the coastline from Santa Monica to Malibu,
                    there's a beach, and you go there to clear your mind.
                    The blue sky and clean air give me peace of mind. Personally,
                    I think coming near the beach gives me emotional stability.'

                    'I think the body and mind are connected as one.
                    It is difficult to talk about the reality of body and mind separately.
                    I think you can maintain your health by balancing your body and mind in your daily life.'

                    'I tend to exercise for a long time when I can. I found a few places not far from home that looked good for a workout.
                    I also walk along the Griffith Park trails and jog near the Silver Lake Reservoir.
                    I also do barbed exercises at a nearby park I recently started cycling,
                    and I feel like I'm traveling all over Los Angeles. It's a great way to exercise outdoors!'

                    'Since the pandemic started, we've been staying at home longer. Still, I try to create a separate space for the health of my body and mind.

                    To be honest, I want to take off my t-shirt so that I can synthesize vitamin D and work out while sweating as much as I can. I usually wear sweat-wicking T-shirts.'

                    'If there is one thing I have realized, it is that everyone lives with their own pain and wounds.
                    Life is never easy, and this year has been a year of greater anxiety.
                    There is a saying about the Lakota tribe. It is said that even when a great storm comes,
                    the bison stand shoulder to shoulder. I think we can overcome emotions like anxiety
                    if we face them head on without avoiding them.'
