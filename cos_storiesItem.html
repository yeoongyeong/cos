                    <strong>FESTIVE KNITS, THE COS WAY</strong>
                    New knitwear to add to the mood of the season Meet the COS knitwear with delicate colors and textures.
                    The design was completed through a new 3D simulation production process,
                    from soft wool material, to the modern-style Fair Isle pattern, and to sensuous details.
                    As design assistant Alex Horvath puts it: 'Based on the swatches, sketches,
                    and size information of COS, we created a 3D model with a team of experts to check the color and texture.
                    It's a sustainable way to cut down on sample making. There are no logistics or shipping costs because the 3D team can send the design directly to the producer.'
                    The COS design team went one step further and designed the product in an environmentally conscious way. We also slightly modified the existing stitches and developed a new Fair Isle pattern.
                    If you want to present a product with a colorful design, a recycled wool mix sweaterCheck it out. It would be nice to present an alpaca wool mix knitwear product that can be easily matched with a variety of looks .

                <p>
                    Styling Tip: The 'relaxed fit sweater is great to wear with tailored
                    trousers or a leather skirt. Pair them with chunky knee-high boots for a modern look.'

                    There's no better product to add to the mood of the season than HANDCRAFTED & RECYCLED JEWELLERY accessories.

                    Design assistant Rahel Pfrommer says: 'It is an item that can be gifted regardless of the season with a timeless design that can be kept for a long time.'
                    Francesca Lilley, Director of COS Sustainability & Brand Strategy, speaks.\
                    'Know the value of timeless design and present

                    <strong>TRACEABLE CASHMERE</strong>
                    COS is designing products using materials that comply with The Good Cashmere Standard
                    to ensure that cashmere products can be manufactured in a 100% sustainable manner by 2022.
                    This helps us understand where cashmere comes from and protects the animal and producer communities.
                    Francesca says: 'As cashmere products receive a lot of love, I want to design products in a more independent and sustainable way.
                    It's like creating timeless products that will last a long time through an ethical manufacturing process.'
                </p>

                    Styling Tip: 'Oversized sweaters are great for a variety of looks.
                    Pair it with tailored trousers for a sensual look. Match it with a code trouser to add a seasonal mood with a thick texture.'
