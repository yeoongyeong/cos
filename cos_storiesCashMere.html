            <strong>Sustainably crafted cashmere</strong>
            Francesca Lilley, Director of COS Sustainability and Brand Strategy, <br>
            talks about sustainable consumption, cashmere and how to make your products last longer.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Since COS was first launched in 2007, it has been loved as a cashmere product.
                    Even if it's not the winter season, it's become a standard seller.
                    Cashmere products deserve to be loved for the fact that they are sustainably crafted using high-quality fabrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Francesca Lilly says that working with COS over the past decade has helped her understand more about the value of sustainability.
                    Join Francesca to learn about ethical consumption and how it can make the world a better place.

                    <strong>ON HER PERSONAL PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY</strong>
                    'I don't think fashion is an integral part of my life. But in the past,
                    I think I mostly bought clothes I liked rather than the functional aspect of clothes. Of course,
                    I bought clothes that will last a long time, and special clothes that will be memorable.
                    It was only after I started working at COS that I understood how important it is to buy good quality clothes.'

                    <strong>ON THE FASHION INDUSTRY</strong>
                    'I think the fashion industry has a lot of homework to solve.
                    Rather than staying at the level of solving existing problems, we need to solve the homework of sustainable fashion in a new way.
                    And I think that fashion companies should be socially responsible and deliver a message to consumers.
                    Not only do we have to be responsible for the way we design and produce our products,
                    but we also have to provide options for consumers to practice sustainable fashion.
                    It is not a problem that individual consumers can never solve.
                    A systematic system must be in place. It's a problem that can only be solved when we all practice sustainable fashion.'

                    <strong>ON THE CHALLENGES WE FACE</strong>
                    'It takes a lot of procedures and costs to supply high-quality products.
                    Even if we try to manufacture products in the way that consumers want,
                    there are many difficulties in the production process that cannot be said.
                    But it is also fun to overcome these difficulties.
                    It's like being able to provide cashmere products with good quality and good prices this time.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I think the most important thing is to raise awareness first.
                    For example, just a decade ago, sustainable fashion didn't get much attention.
                    Because most people aren't very interested in products made from recycled fabrics.
                    But now, they are loved in all aspects of style, fashion, and quality.
                    We are able to provide good quality clothes that are like new products.
                    If the quality of the recycled product is excellent, how good is the quality of the product before recycling?'

                    <strong>ON COS CASHMERE</strong>
                    'In the last few years, cashmere products have been loved and we have started to produce a lot.
                    In addition to producing products that meet ethical and environmental standards,
                    we strive to protect both consumer and producer rights. A good product, in my opinion,
                    is not just a product that looks good, but a product that is produced in a sustainable way and feels comfortable to wear.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'At COS, we make products using recycled cashmere fabric.
                    It also adds value to the product by recycling unused scraps of fabric.
                    In this process, I was able to share the fabric, producer, and product production process more transparently.
                    We use fabrics that have passed the Sustainable Good Cashmere Standard and are committed to the welfare of producers and animals. We're talking about producing high-quality cashmere products and helping
                    consumers make better choices.'
