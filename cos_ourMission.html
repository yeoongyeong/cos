            COS pursues a more sustainable future regardless of season or trend.<br>
            We work with local communities, supply chains and partners to create collections using innovative materials.

                <p>
                    <strong>In 2020, 76% of the collection's materials were produced
                       in a sustainable way.</strong>
                    <strong>By 2021, we have switched 86% to sustainable materials.</strong> 
                    <strong> Our goal is to achieve a transition to 100% recyclable and sustainable materials and
                        become an environmentally friendly brand.</strong>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the beginning of the brand, our design philosophy has been to pursue quality <br>
                    and sustainable quality. We believe that our choices, our clothes and our lives <br>
                    can do more for less.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are committed to finding quality, environmentally friendly materials. <br>
                    It's not just the fabric or decoration that makes a product sustainable, <br>
                    but working in an environmentally friendly way also plays an important role in making <br>
                    a product sustainable. At COS, this is called environmental responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustainability is not just about minimizing our impact on the environment. <br>
                    As a company, we set ethical standards and focus on our commitment to the people and <br>
                    communities who make our products. We call this social responsibility, and we believe the <br>
                    strong relationships we have built with our suppliers around the world are paramount to <br>
                    meeting our goals and standards.

                    <strong>Organic Materials</strong>
                    The organic materials used by COS are grown from organic seeds that have not <br>
                    undergone any genetic modification. Because no chemicals or synthetic fertilizers are <br>
                    used in the cultivation process, it is beneficial to both the global environment and <br>
                    humankind. We are also exploring new technologies and production methods. <br>
                    For example, growing organic crops in a renewable way. As a result, <br>
                    maintaining healthy soils helps combat climate change and water scarcity.

                    2020: 17.4% of all products used organic materials <br>

                    COS deals with certified materials in three categories. <br>
                    Environment, animal welfare and social responsibility. Working with an independent <br>
                    certification program, we provide our customers with materials that are traceable and <br>
                    ethically crafted.

                <p>
                    2020: 50.8% of certified materials used in all materials <br>
                    2021: 35.2% of certified materials used in all materials so far, expected to exceed <br>
                    last year’s figure by the end of 2021

                    <strong>Recycled & Refurbished Materials</strong>
                    Recycled cotton, wool, polyester and nylon materials use fewer chemicals, <br>
                    reducing demand for limited natural resources. We also collect discarded and leftover <br>
                    materials to design refurbished items in our collections in cotton, wool and cashmere. <br>
                    Because of the complexity of the refurbishment process, there aren't many brands that <br>
                    can do it at the scale we're working on. <br>
                    There's a lot more could be done, but I'm proud that COS is leading the way. <br>
                    Through new production processes and innovative methods, we will increase <br>
                    the  proportion of recycled materials and maintain high-quality materials. <br>
                    We aim to produce 30% of recycled materials by 2025.

                    <strong>Existing materials</strong>
                    We make products that can be with us for a long time. We also use conventional <br>
                    materials such as leather or silk to meet the high quality we seek. Meanwhile, <br>
                    we strive to find better alternative materials and help the material industry develop.

                <p>
                    We have replaced a lot of synthetic materials with recycled materials, <br>
                    and we are also replacing silk with organic silk. By fall 2021, all leather goods are aiming <br>
                    to be made with a cleaner tanning method without the use of metallic chrome.

                    reduced the amount of COS packages our customers receive when they place an order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use to protect clothing during <br>
                    shipping, and we are increasing the proportion of packaging that is reusable, <br>
                    recyclable and environmentally friendly. In the distribution process, <br>
                    we attempted to replace plastic bags with reusable cloth bags. As a result, <br>
                    this plan has been implemented on a larger scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to reach 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging by 2025.

                    collection has all kinds of sustainably produced materials, highlighting this to 
                    help customers make more thoughtful shopping decisions.

                <p>
                    To qualify as a 'sustainable material', a product must be made from at least 50% 
                    sustainable materials. Some of our products contain more than 50%! With the exception 
                    of recycled and refurbished materials, the overall quality of materials meets 
                    our standards.

                    REPURPOSED COTTON
                    <p>
                        Refurbished Cotton is a new yarn made from our scrap fabric, which can reduce land,
                        water and energy usage. This yarn is mixed with longer fibers to create a more durable 
                        yarn. Breathing new life into scrap fabric like this is one of our most pioneering attempts.

                    <p>
                        Yak wool is made from the hair of a yak that grows in the Himalayan pastures. 
                        A material that can be identified and traced to its supply path and produce 
                        in a sustainable manner.

                    REPURPOSED WOOL
                    <p>
                        The wool fibers we use are of the highest quality, which also means that good fibers can 
                        be turned into new fabrics. It is more difficult to guarantee the quality of the fabric if you 
                        reuse low-quality fibers in the first place. That's why not many brands reuse wool on a 
                        scale as large as COS.

                    <p>
                        Refurbished Cashmere is made from surplus left over from the manufacturing process.
                        In this way, the impact on the environment can be minimized and precious resources can 
                        be fully used. Due to the complexity of the process, it is not uncommon to reuse 
                        cashmere. We are proud to be at the forefront of transforming these production chains.

                        Recycled down used for outerwear and accessories is an eco-friendly thermal insulation 
                        material that is manufactured in an environmentally friendly way. It has excellent thermal 
                        insulation properties and is often used for padded jackets and bedding.
                        It is recycled through a disinfection process with solar energy and recycled water.

                        Using recycled nylon can reduce demand for limited resources. It uses less energy and chemicals and 
                        produces less carbon dioxide than conventional nylon. Various waste 
                        materials, such as fishing nets, can also be turned into new clothes.

                        We manufacture padding and accessory products from down materials that have

                        The recycled polyester in the COS collection is made from production waste generated
                        during consumption. This is a much better way than making new polyester from crude 
                        oil. Crude oil is non-renewable and is increasingly being depleted. Recycled polyester 
                        can also be reused over and over again.

                        The cashmere left over from the production process can be used to add new value to

                        TENCEL™ is the only lyocell fiber brand known to be sustainable. This natural material is 
                        crafted from forest eucalyptus trees that are FSC-certified, demonstrating responsible 
                        forest management for ecosystem conservation. The tree is made in a circular 
                        production process, reusing 99% of all chemicals and water instead of releasing it into 
                        nature. The result is a beautiful material that is soft to the touch, airy, washable and wraps around the body.
