            <strong>Mitchell Belk's Fit Guide</strong>
            Stylist Mitchell Belk, who has worked with COS for many years, <br>
            talks about finding the right fit for you.  
        </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    <strong>'Once you understand your body type, it's easy to find the right fit.'</strong>
                    'If you understand your body shape well, it is easy to find a fit that fits you well.'
                    Renowned stylist and fashion director for the independent men's magazine Port,
                    Mitchell Belk, shares tips on finding the right fit for you. Inspired by this,
                    we started the COS Fit project, which added 4 new fits to the COS men's collection and styled
                    by Mitchell. 'Whether it's a slim, regular, relaxed or oversized fit, the most important thing is to
                    understand your body shape properly. No matter how perfect the styling, if the fit is not right,
                    the look will look poor.'

                    <strong>ON HIS INSPIRATION</strong>
                    'I always try not to lose the classic look. Looking at photos of men in workwear,
                    suits and sportswear from the 1930s and 1940s,
                    there is a classic feel to them. With this in mind,
                    I try not to lose the classic mood while doing various styling.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ON FINDING YOUR FIT</strong>
                    'It is important to understand your body type and find a fit that fits you well.
                    No matter how expensive the clothes are, if they don't fit, it's meaningless.
                    That's not to say that tall people can't wear a slim fit, or skinny people can't wear an oversized fit.
                    The most important thing is to find a fit that meets your standards.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'It is also important to properly understand your body type.
                    If you have a stocky physique, you look slimmer in regular fit than skinny jeans.
                    Likewise, if a skinny person wears a regular fit top, it will look like an oversized fit.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ON STYLING THE DIFFERENT FITS</strong>
                    'If you want to give a more professional look ahead of your meeting,
                    choose clothes that fit well and are tailored.
                    On your days off, have a comfortable time with loose fit and soft material items.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'There are no rules when it comes to styling. If you want to emphasize something,
                    you can match items of the opposite fit. If you want to emphasize the overall look,
                    it is recommended to unify them with the same fit.'

                <p>
                    <strong>SLIM</strong>
                    'Slim Fit goes well with other slim fit items, but I also like to layer it lightly.
                    Add a t-shirt and shirt jacket to fit slim trousers for a classic look.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>REGULAR</strong>
                    'Regular fit items are good for casual styling.
                    Most men will probably consider a regular fit as the standard.
                    That's why I try different styling by rolling up cuffs or sleeves.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>RELAXED</strong>
                    'The relaxed fit is not too overdone, and I like it to be slightly loose and relaxed.
                    I use a drape to style a half chin with half the top hem, or style the trouser hem to cover the shoes.
                    The most important point here is to maintain a relaxed fit, but style it to reveal the silhouette.'

                    <strong>ON FINDING THE RIGHT LENGTH</strong>
                    'High Rise Trousers are great for pairing with socks, shoes,
                    and sneakers that expose your ankles or accentuate your ankles.
                    Wearing low-rise trousers will make you look taller and make your legs look very long.
                    You can also create heavy and wide shoes together.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ON THE PIECES EVERY PERSON SHOULD OWN</strong>
                    'A tailored classic shirt , T-shirt, suit, and denim jeans that fit well are good items to have.
                    Tailored items do not stick to the body and have a suitable fit,
                    so it is good for various styling. You can express a different side of yourself by doing different styles.'
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <strong>ON EVERYDAY STYLING</strong>
                    'You can create a new silhouette by adding a little hem or rolling up the sleeves or cuffs,
                    and you can complete the overall sensual styling.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Trying on a lot of clothes and going through trial and error helps with styling.
                    Don't just do simple styling, try new styling. Don't worry about unfamiliar sizes or silhouettes,
                    and don't take your clothes too seriously. If you try a lot, you'll realize that you can do a variety of styles with items you've never worn before.'
