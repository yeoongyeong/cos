            <strong>Street View: Auckland</strong>
            Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Auckland is a multicultural center and representative volcanic region. <br>
            Auckland, in particular, is famous for its architecture and is also the birthplace of Flat White. <br>
            Hear the story of Auckland from photographer Blake Dunlop.

                <p>
                    'For the past five years, I have been traveling between Indonesia and New Zealand.
                    Located on the edge of Polynesia, this small but beautiful island, with a population of less than 5 million,
                    has a lifestyle and plantation culture not often found in the city center.
                    If I could sum up Auckland in one word, I think it could be described as a multicultural city
                    where Maori culture and Pacific, Asian, and European cultures all come together.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I currently live in Auckland with my spouse and I want to live here for a long time to come.
                    The residents here live with bohemian free sensibility and flexible emotions. In particular
                    this sentiment seems to be working quite flexibly in understanding the phenomenon of
                    gentrification in Auckland. People are saddened by the loss of their existing culture or identity,
                    but they are also welcomed by the rejuvenation of new restaurants and cultural facilities throughout the community.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I picked up the camera to convey this kind of Auckland as it really is.
                    I wanted to capture the everyday and natural aspects of Auckland, which the people here consider as their home.'

                    <strong>MY CITY</strong>
                    'I've been to the places I usually visit. The similarly shaped arches, stairs,
                    and stone materials used in the building create a similar atmosphere between the different spaces.
                    It felt as if I had stumbled upon an old friend twice a day. Of course,
                    that's what really happens in this small city. You can't see a person in the picture,
                    but imagine it through the back of the lens. Line up to order coffee at the Daily Bread,
                    stumble upon an empty table at Lilian, and dine at the Ponsonby food court before dining at the gallery or The Crystal Palace.
                    It's kind of like catching an Uber to the Palace Theatre.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I mainly take portraits, so it felt fresh to capture an urban area like this. Personally,
                    I'm used to capturing the expression of a specific person, so I think I was able to capture the expression
                    and atmosphere of each building when I was taking pictures of it.
                    It is especially memorable that we were able to capture Auckland's yesterday
                    and today in one frame through this shoot.'

                    <strong>ON ART &amp; CULTURE</strong>
                    'I love Andres Serrano's eccentric work and Wayne Lawrence's Orchard Beach work.
                    If you were born and raised in New Zealand, you'll know that Tom Gould broke new ground in the short film world and Derek Henderson put New Zealand in a new light in this square frame.
                    In fact, I feel ashamed when I see works like this. It's like when you see a master's work,
                    you don't like your work and want to hide.'

                    'I think it's really great to learn Indonesian and to face the new and diverse cultures that are unfolding as you start to understand the language a little bit.
                    It may be the most impressive thing since I became an adult, and it may have a big impact on the works 
                    and ideas I work on in the future.'

                    <strong>MY PROCESS</strong>
                    'The beauty of photography is that you can look at things more systematically and
                    meticulously. Until now, I had taken photos in the form of observational documentaries,
                    but now I think my interest in directing and shooting random scenes has diminished.
                    I'm not shooting deliberately consciously, but these days, I'm shooting with a focus on
                    things that are less familiar and less familiar.'

                    <strong>ON STAYING CREATIVE</strong>
                    'The moment you try to imitate someone else, it's going to be painful.
                    Compare who you are yesterday and today, not someone else today.
                    To paraphrase Alain de Button,
                    "If anyone looks back at himself around this time last year and doesn't feel any shame, he may not be learning enough." I want to tell a story.
                    Personally, I tend to be motivated whenever I realize how short life is.
                    Wake up early in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and find something that piques your curiosity.'
