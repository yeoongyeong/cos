                    ' What are the elements of a perfect white shirt ?'
                    ' This is a question that became the starting point when
                    designing an oversized fit shirt that the COS womenswear design team reinterpreted.
                    Hear why womenswear design director Karin Gustafson loves white shirts.
                    'I like the white shirt the most. I think it's attractive to create
                    a flexible silhouette with a light volume on a newly designed
                    classic item.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    This season, add exaggerated details like an oversized collar or cuffs to create a relaxed silhouette shirt.
                    It has the feel of a classic Oxford shirt by retaining the rounded side hem and gusset detailing.
                    The A-line silhouette adds volume to the shirt by adding round hem and box pleats,
                    and it's finished with a soft drop shoulder design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design team made it a priority to make the shirt in a sustainable way.
                    The white shirt is made from pure organic cotton grown without chemicals or synthetic fertilizers,
                    using seeds that have not been genetically modified.
                    The resulting shirt is soft to the touch and less wrinkled,
                    making it perfect for everyday wear.

                    tailored coat finished with a timeless design can sensibly create any outfit.
                    It is doing both the role of protecting the body warm from the cold and the role of creating a sensual layered look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The London COS design team designed a double-breasted coat with a slightly relaxed fit and long length.
                    It is made from a blend of wool that complies with the Responsible Wool Standard to understand
                    the source of wool and protect animals and the producer community.
                    Recycled polyester adds softness and durability, and can be worn all season long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by classic menswear tailoring, it features an oversized collar and sleek front pockets,
                    with special attention to the lining of the coat. If you look closely,
                    you'll notice that the lining design is just as good as the exterior design.
                    The luxurious wool on the outside and the edging between the lining contrasts,
                    adding to the sensual design.

                    With a long neckline and dropped shoulder design,
                    high-density materials are used to ensure warmth and quality.

                    Known for their unparalleled soft feel, cashmere is a worthwhile investment for the winter season.
                    If you take good care of it, you can wear it for a long time.
                    The design team used long-haired cashmere to make it durable and durable.

                    is a must for women in sophisticated tailoring with a modern reinterpretation.
                    This is because you can create a variety of styles by matching it with other items every day.
                    Inspired by menswear tailoring, the COS three-piece suit is crafted from soft materials and supple silhouettes.
                    Discover the benefits of suits, explained by Karin, Womenswear Design Director.
                    She said, 'It's a suit that can be created with a natural and flexible silhouette and that makes the proportions of the body more beautiful.'
                    The oversized blazer made of certified wool material is great for natural styling.
                    Add a vest and tailored wide trousers to create a complete look.
