                    COS has long considered fashion regardless of the season as important.
                    He has been loved by many people around the world by creating a collection of
                    timeless designs while avoiding fast fashion that is easy to put on and throw away.
                    Now people can use the new resell platform to make their clothes last a little longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resell was completed through a process in which COS internal staff collaborated.
                    At the heart of this project are Anna Karlstrom of the Sustainability Team,
                    Marie-Soleil Verville Allard, Digital Project Manager, and Lise Hasselgaard,
                    Global Project Manager. These employees are familiar with COS Resell 's journey from a small conversation to a project.
                    We spoke with Anna about the journey of the Resell project, and Liz and Marie shared how they have utilized the new Resell platform to date.

                    <strong>ON THE THINKING BEHIND RESELL</strong>
                    “Which clothes do you keep without throwing away?”
                    'This project started from such a simple conversation.
                    We always wear COSI did not throw it away and continued to wear it even after the season passed.
                    COS clothes are made of high-quality materials, are not limited by the season, and have a timeless design that can be worn for a long time.
                    It's like reselling to other people in advance. It's good to organize what you're wearing and send it to others.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'I see resell as an opportunity to bring products back to the COS community in an environmentally friendly way.
                    I know that designing long-lasting clothes isn't enough. Even if our products leave the customer's hands,
                    I think there has to be a way to give them back value. That way,
                    we can show that the products our customers have invested in are valuable and useful,
                    and we believe that by making COS products return to their place, we can maintain the sustainability we seek.'

                    <strong>ON THE CHALLENGES</strong>
                    'We came together to create something useful for the COS community,
                    and that should be a new experience. We don't have rules or plans for a project or a model for moving forward,
                    we just take risks and get into work. You bump and fail and keep trying until you realize something special.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'It was difficult to launch the COS Resell platform in the time of Corona,
                    but we decided it was the best time to add our own brand identity,
                    and we want to celebrate it as the beginning of a new chapter.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ON THE FUTURE OF THE PLATFORM</strong>
                    'Initially, we tried to understand how our customers reacted while piloting our resell platform in the UK and Germany.
                    The results really exceeded expectations.
                    Some customers show their passion to dress up their mannequins and take photos to share.
                    What a memorable customer response!'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'The next goal is to launch the resell platform in as many countries as possible around the world.
                    It will strengthen the COS community and have more impactful results.'

                    <strong>ON SHOPPING PRELOVED</strong>
                    'I don't shop second-hand to buy one-of-a-kind products or simply to save money.
                    Buying clothes that the previous owner loved can also help the global environment affected by the culture of throwing away clothes easily.
                    It's like spending for the future that people want.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Reselling is one way to make a brand a little more sustainable, and there's a lot more it can do.
                    Leaders must devise innovative ways to reduce chemicals and reuse and recycle fabrics,
                    making COS a brand that leads a new and better era.'
