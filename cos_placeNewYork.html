                    The design philosophy of COS is reflected not only in the collections presented every season,
                    but also in the stores where the collections are presented.

                    Learn about design that considers the environment through the Resell platform , a sustainable material .
                    COS stores and interior design teams use innovative materials to design products and stores,
                    and strive to minimize their environmental impact.
                    It was in the same vein that I collaborated with Studio Woojai while preparing to open the COS Galleria
                    Gwanggyo branch in Suwon in March 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designer Woojae Lee created a new object using newspaper. Recycled pulp is made from newspaper,
                    and pulp and glue are mixed to give the brick shape. What was the result?
                    An object was created that had a feeling similar to the marble marbling,
                    but also had a warm and soft texture unique to paper. About this project,
                    Delphine says: 'I think it was a very natural collaboration. Studio Woojae developed a material that is
                    both excellent in design and sustainable.
                    In order to make a better world like this project, I think we should continue to develop and make
                    sustainable materials.'

                    <strong>New York: A unique experience</strong>
                    What better way to launch a new kids collection than to set up a kid's space at the COS Fifth Avenue
                    store?
                    The COS interior team created a mood board using the elements of art and architecture,
                    and incorporated the colorful colors of the kids collection into the interior. As Louise Welsh,
                    COS Interior Project Manager, says: 'Rather than simply
                    presenting this collection, I wanted to create a space to communicate with customers.
                    In particular, it is a space where children can rmun around and have fun.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    From sustainable rubber to powder-coated metal rails,
                    a variety of materials and textures create a space reminiscent of a children's playground.
                    Thanks to the space where they can experience and meet the new collection,
                    it is possible to present a special experience to customers visiting COS.

                    <strong>Zurich: A Hidden Story in Design</strong>
                    Just looking at the cafe Einstein frequented or the 19th-century Utoke Lake Resort tells us that Zurich
                    is a city steeped in history.
                    The bank, located in the historic city of Zurich,
                    on one of the best shopping streets, has recently been reborn as a COS Bahnhofstrasse store.
                    The Bahnhofstrasse store is a concept store with three floors.
                    Store manager Michelle Spahr has this to say about the store:
                    'It is located in the middle of the Bahnhofstrasse, so it is a store visited by many tourists.
                    Every day is always new when you're here.'
                </p>
            </div>            
        </div>
        <div class="rimgLtxt">
            <img src="images/COSplaceNewyork05.png" alt="placeNewYork05">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Whenever designing a new store, there are many things to think about.
                    We have to work while maintaining the existing architectural elements.
                    So was the Bahnhofstrasse store. Delphine Gautier, director of the interior team,
                    says: 'The bank, which has been in this position for a long time, was a very important place.
                    The interior was nice too. So when designing a new store, we couldn't ignore the elements of the bank building.
                    It had to be designed while considering the meaning and value of this space and architectural elements.'
                    The existing exterior walls, marble mosaic flooring, terracotta columns,
                    and even the bank safe deposit box were all reinterpreted and designed based on the design philosophy of COS.
                    With the in-house team of COS, we started a new chapter based on sustainable design.
                    Discover the Fall Winter collections in our newly opened store and online store in Zurich.
